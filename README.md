# Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur (Work In Progress)

## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in intermediate work on the Infocom game Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur.

## Where did it come from?

The contents of this repository were imported from [a zip file](https://eblong.com/infocom/sources/arthur-rmid1.zip) hosted on [The Obsessively Complete Infocom Catalog](https://eblong.com/infocom/).

There are other public sources of this material available on the internet.

[Infocom Sources (copy)]: https://github.com/zil-legacy/infocom-sources/tree/master/development/arthur/oldarthur

\* This comes from a partial, source code only archive of "The Infocom Drive".

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if a game file can be built from the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
